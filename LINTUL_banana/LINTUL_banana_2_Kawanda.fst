TITLE Water-limited production in East African highland banana cropping system

***Remarks
***This program assumes an established banana plantation.
***Initialisation should always be between TSUM1 is 2262 and 2423(referring to plant 1
***- mother).In that physiological time period, a mother plant and sucker 1, are present,
***but not yet sucker 2. Thus, only sucker 2 goes through the juvenile stage and the
***prejuvenile stage, where it has no functionalleaves yet.
***Units used throughout the program are hectare (ha), kg, degree celcius (C),
***MJ for radiation and days (d).

PARAM pcorm1_To_ReAllocation      = 0.5
*Approximate proportion of corm dry matter of harvested plant that has been stored
*at the harvest moment and that wil be re-distributed to the new plant 1.
*The name "pcorm1_To_ReAllocation" is new (PAL22Jun2012)

*After about 4 months (120 days), 1% of the original corm dry matter will be left
*RDRCorm1_After_Harv = 1n(0.01)/(-120) = 0.038 d-1
*Assumption: No death of corm during growth
*There is (22Jun2012) corm-decay and corm redistribution. To this purpose the corm1 at
*harvest is stored in Corm1_After_Harv and Corm1_Lost_After_Harv. Then Corm1_After_Harv is
*re-allocated to DM1 that has just become the new plant, and Corm1_Lost_After_Harv is decomposed
*as organic matter. The (relative)decay rate to control the decrease of the dead corm (with
*1% left after 4 months) is 0.03838.
******PALOLD:
****There is corm-decay and corm redistribution. If we take the (relative)decay rate to
****control the decrease of the corm as a whole (with 1% left after 4 months), the fraction
****"Corm1Dm_transferprop" goes to the plant1 Wsh1, and the remainder "(1 - Corm1Dm_transferprop)"
****goes to the organic matter of the soil, that is not further specified.

**** splitting up in parts the shoot was harvested as a whole, and this was obvious
**** from the line "NEWVALUE Wsh1 = HELPWsh2", where the whole of the Wsh1 is
**** replaced by Wsh2 (at that moment contained in the variable HELPWsh2). But after
**** the splitting up in corm, psstm, leaves and bunch, the corm is not harvested.
**** It is remaining in the soil, instead. Therefore, the balances BalRtShHlp1 and
**** BalRtShHlp4 are not working properly anymore. This could only be changed if
**** a helpvariable would be introduced that also represents Wsh1 as a whole.
**** This has not been done, however, so BalRtShHlp1 and BalRtShHlp4 are not
**** correct anymore after the introduction of the different shoot parts.

*After the shift, at TSUM2=TSUMshfhv=2298 Cd (coinciding with TSUM1=TSUMHARV=

*However, the dry matter now goes to sucker 1 (previous sucker 2) and comes from
